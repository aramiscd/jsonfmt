module Parse

{-
    A simple parser-combinator module.

    This work is part of my first attempt at non-trivial
    parsing.  It is motivated by this presentation:
    https://vimeo.com/171704565

    Parser-combinators are surprisingly accessible.

    First, we collect tokens as lists of strings using the
    `string` function and some basic parsers.  From these
    tokens we can construct other data using those same
    combinators and the `map` function, perhaps discarding
    tokens using the `throwAway` function.

    For practical reasons most functions in this module
    rely on lists.  We can, of course, parse into any data
    type, but once we leave the monadic context of a list,
    we lose the ability to assemble values from multiple
    tokens and to pull apart or throw away values.

{-
    A `Parser a` attempts to turn a `String` into a
    value of type `a`.

    If it fails, it results in an `Err errs` where `errs`
    is a list of `ParseError` values.  If it succeeds,
    it results in an `Ok ( n , v , s )` where `n` is the
    number of consumed characters, `v` is a value of type
    `a` and `s` is the remaining input.
